# Children's Books Library Application

The Children's Books Library Application is a web application designed to provide a collection of children's books,
 allowing users to browse through the library, and manage their favorite titles by adding or removing a book from the list,
 and ultimately being able to add a book to the library, all in one convenient place.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the Children's Books Library Application 
on your local machine for development and testing purposes:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git.

2. Navigate to the project directory using the command cd repo-name.

3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the command npm install.

4. Start the application using the command npm start.

5. The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser.

You can now browse the collection of books, search for specific titles, and add books to your reading list. To make changes to the application, simply modify the code and refresh the page to see the updates.

## Next Steps

 - I plan to add a reviews feature to the application in the future, allowing users to leave feedback and ratings on the books they have read. This will provide valuable information for other users and help them make informed decisions when choosing their next read. 
 - In addition to the reviews feature, I am also considering adding an age recommendation for each book in the application. This would help users determine if a particular book is appropriate for them or for someone they are purchasing it for. 
- Stay tuned for updates on these exciting new features!
